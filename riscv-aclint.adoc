== Change Log

=== Version 1.0

* Dedicated chapter on synchronizing multiple MTIMER devices
* Initial release with MTIMER, MSWI, and SSWI devices

== Introduction

This RISC-V ACLINT specification defines a set of memory mapped devices
which provide inter-processor interrupts (IPI) and timer functionalities
for each HART on a multi-HART RISC-V platform. These HART-level IPI and
timer functionalities are required by operating systems, bootloaders and
firmwares running on a multi-HART RISC-V platform.

The SiFive Core-Local Interruptor (CLINT) device has been widely adopted in
the RISC-V world to provide machine-level IPI and timer functionalities.
Unfortunately, the SiFive CLINT has a unified register map for both IPI and
timer functionalities and it does not provide supervisor-level IPI
functionality.

The RISC-V ACLINT specification takes a more modular approach by defining
separate memory mapped devices for IPI and timer functionalities. This
modularity allows RISC-V platforms to omit some of the RISC-V ACLINT devices
for when the platform has an alternate mechanism. In addition to modularity,
the RISC-V ACLINT specification also defines a dedicated memory mapped device
for supervisor-level IPIs. The <<table_aclint_device_list>> below shows the
list of devices defined by the RISC-V ACLINT specification.

=== Backward Compatibility With SiFive CLINT

The RISC-V ACLINT specification is defined to be backward compatible with the
SiFive CLINT specification. The register definitions and register offsets of
the MTIMER and MSWI devices are compatible with the timer and IPI registers
defined by the SiFive CLINT specification. A SiFive CLINT device on a RISC-V
platform can be logically seen as one MSWI device and one MTIMER devices
placed next to each other in the memory address space as shown in
<<table_sifive_clint_compatibility>> below.

== Machine-level Timer Device (MTIMER)

The MTIMER device provides machine-level timer functionality for a set of
HARTs on a RISC-V platform. It has a single fixed-frequency monotonic time
counter (*MTIME*) register and a time compare register (*MTIMECMP*) for
each HART connected to the MTIMER device. A MTIMER device not connected
to any HART should only have a MTIME register and no MTIMECMP registers.

On a RISC-V platform with multiple MTIMER devices:

* Each MTIMER device provides machine-level timer functionality for a different
(or disjoint) set of HARTs. A MTIMER device assigns a HART index starting
from zero to each HART associated with it. The HART index assigned to a HART
by the MTIMER device may or may not have any relationship with the unique
HART identifier (*hart ID*) that the RISC-V Privileged Architecture assigns
to the HART.
* Two or more MTIMER devices can share the same physical MTIME register while
having their own separate MTIMECMP registers.
* The MTIMECMP registers of a MTIMER device must only compare against the
MTIME register of the same MTIMER device for generating machine-level timer
interrupt.

The maximum number of HARTs supported by a single MTIMER device is 4095
which is equivalent to the maximum number of MTIMECMP registers.

=== Register Map

A MTIMER device has two separate base addresses: one for the MTIME register
and another for the MTIMECMP registers. These separate base addresses of a
single MTIMER device allows multiple MTIMER devices to share the same
physical MTIME register.

The <<table_aclint_mtimer_time_register_list>> below shows map of the MTIME
register whereas the <<table_aclint_mtimer_compare_register_list>> below
shows map of the MTIMECMP registers relative to separate base addresses.

=== MTIME Register (Offset: 0x00000000)

The MTIME register is a 64-bit read-write register that contains the number
of cycles counted based on a fixed reference frequency.

On MTIMER device reset, the MTIME register is cleared to zero.

=== MTIMECMP Registers (Offsets: 0x00000000 - 0x00007FF0)

The MTIMECMP registers are per-HART 64-bit read-write registers. It contains
the MTIME register value at which machine-level timer interrupt is to be
triggered for the corresponding HART.

The machine-level timer interrupt of a HART is pending whenever MTIME is
greater than or equal to the value in the corresponding MTIMECMP register
whereas the machine-level timer interrupt of a HART is cleared whenever
MTIME is less than the value of the corresponding MTIMECMP register. The
machine-level timer interrupt is reflected in the MTIP bit of the `mip`
CSR.

On MTIMER device reset, the MTIMECMP registers are in unknown state.

=== Synchronizing Multiple MTIME Registers

A RISC-V platform can have multiple HARTs grouped into hierarchical topology
groups (such as clusters, nodes, or sockets) where each topology group has
it's own MTIMER device. Further, such RISC-V platforms can also allow
clock-gating or powering off for a topology group (including the MTIMER
device) at runtime.

On a RISC-V platform with multiple MTIMER devices residing on the same die,
each device must satisfy the RISC-V architectural requirement that all the
MTIME registers with respect to each other, and all the per-HART `time` CSRs
with respect to each other, are synchronized to within one MTIME tick period.
For example, if the MTIME tick period is 10ns, then the MTIME registers, and
their associated time CSRs, should respectively be synchronized to within
10ns of each other.

On a RISC-V platform with multiple MTIMER devices on different die, the
MTIME registers (and their associated `time` CSRs) on different die may be
synchronized to only within a specified interval of each other that is larger
than the MTIME tick period. A platform may define a maximum allowed interval.

To satisfy the preceding MTIME synchronization requirements:

* All MTIME registers should have the same input clock so as to avoid runtime
  drift between separate MTIME registers (and their associated `time` CSRs)
* Upon system reset, the hardware must initialize and synchronize all MTIME
  registers to zero
* When a MTIMER device is stopped and started again due to, say, power
  management actions, the software should re-synchronize this MTIME register 
  with all other MTIME registers

When software updates one, multiple, or all MTIME registers, it must maintain
the preceding synchronization requirements (through measuring and then taking
into account the differing latencies of performing reads or writes to the
different MTIME registers).

As an example, the below RISC-V 64-bit assembly sequence can be used by
software to synchronize a MTIME register with reference to another MTIME
register.

[underline]*_NOTE_*: On some RISC-V platforms, the MTIME synchronization
sequence (i.e. the `aclint_mtime_sync()` function above) will need to be
repeated few times until delta between target MTIME register and reference
MTIME register is zero (or very close to zero).

== Machine-level Software Interrupt Device (MSWI)

The MSWI device provides machine-level IPI functionality for a set of
HARTs on a RISC-V platform. It has an IPI register (*MSIP*) for each
HART connected to the MSWI device.

On a RISC-V platform with multiple MSWI devices, each MSWI device provides
machine-level IPI functionality for a different (or disjoint) set of HARTs. A
MSWI device assigns a HART index starting from zero to each HART associated
with it. The HART index assigned to a HART by the MSWI device may or may not
have any relationship with the unique HART identifier (*hart ID*) that the
RISC-V Privileged Architecture assigns to the HART.

The maximum number of HARTs supported by a single MSWI device is 4095
which is equivalent to the maximum number of MSIP registers.

=== MSIP Registers (Offsets: 0x00000000 - 0x00003FF8)

Each MSIP register is a 32-bit wide WARL register where the upper 31 bits
are wired to zero. The least significant bit is reflected in MSIP of the
`mip` CSR. A machine-level software interrupt for a HART is pending or
cleared by writing `1` or `0` respectively to the corresponding MSIP
register.

On MSWI device reset, each MSIP register is cleared to zero.

== Supervisor-level Software Interrupt Device (SSWI)

The SSWI device provides supervisor-level IPI functionality for a set of
HARTs on a RISC-V platform. It provides a register to set an IPI (*SETSSIP*)
for each HART connected to the SSWI device.

On a RISC-V platform with multiple SSWI devices, each SSWI device provides
supervisor-level IPI functionality for a different (or disjoint) set of HARTs.
A SSWI device assigns a HART index starting from zero to each HART associated
with it. The HART index assigned to a HART by the SSWI device may or may not
have any relationship with the unique HART identifier (*hart ID*) that the
RISC-V Privileged Architecture assigns to the HART.

The maximum number of HARTs supported by a single SSWI device is 4095 which
is equivalent to the maximum number of SETSSIP registers.

=== SETSSIP Registers (Offsets: 0x00000000 - 0x00003FF8)

Each SETSSIP register is a 32-bit wide WARL register where the upper 31 bits
are wired to zero. The least significant bit of a SETSSIP register always
reads `0`. Writing `0` to the least significant bit of a SETSSIP register
has no effect whereas writing `1` to the least significant bit sends an
edge-sensitive interrupt signal to the corresponding HART causing the HART
to set SSIP in the `mip` CSR. Writes to a SETSSIP register are guaranteed to
be reflected in SSIP of the corresponding HART but not necessarily immediately.

[sidebar]
--
[underline]*_NOTE_*: The RISC-V Privileged Architecture defines SSIP in
`mip` and `sip` CSRs as a writeable bit so the M-mode or S-mode software
can directly clear SSIP.
