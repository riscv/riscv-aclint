* Dedicated section on synchnronizing multiple MTIMER devices
* Initial release with MTIMER, MSWI, and SSWI devices

== Introduction

This RISC-V ACLINT specification defines a set of memory mapped devices
which provide inter-processor interrupts (IPI) and timer functionalities
for each HART on a multi-HART RISC-V platform. These HART-level IPI and
timer functionalities are required by operating systems, bootloaders and
firmwares running on a multi-HART RISC-V platform.

The SiFive Core-Local Interruptor (CLINT) device has been widely in RISC-V
world to provide machine-level IPI and timer functionaities. Unfortunately,
the SiFive CLINT has an unified register map for both IPI and timer
functionalities and it does not provide supervisor-level IPI functionality.

The RISC-V ACLINT specification takes a more modular approach by defining
separate memory mapped devices for IPI and timer functionalities. This
modularity allows RISC-V platforms to omit some of the RISC-V ACLINT devices
for which platform has alternate mechanism. In addition to modularity, the
RISC-V ACLINT specification also defines a dedicated memory mapped device
for supervisor-level IPIs. The <<table_aclint_device_list>> below shows the
list of devices defined by the RISC-V ACLINT specification.

=== Backward Compatibility With SiFive CLINT

The RISC-V ACLINT specification is defined to be backward compatible with the
SiFive CLINT specification. The register definitions and register offsets of
the MTIMER and MSWI devices are compatible with the timer and IPI registers
defined by the SiFive CLINT specification. A SiFive CLINT device on a RISC-V
platform can be logically seen as one MSWI device and one MTIMER devices
placed next to each other in the memory address space as shown in
<<table_sifive_clint_compatiblity>> below.

== Machine-level Timer Device (MTIMER)

The MTIMER device provides machine-level timer functionality for a set of
HARTs on a RISC-V platform. It has a single fixed-frequency monotonic time
counter (*MTIME*) register and a time compare register (*MTIMECMP*) for
each HART connected to the MTIMER device.

The maximum number of HARTs supported by a single MTIMER device is 4095
which is equivalent to the maximum number of MTIMECMP registers.

=== MTIME Register (Offset: 0x00007FF8)

The MTIME register is a 64-bit read-write register that contains the number
of cycles counted based on a fixed reference frequency.

On reset, MTIME is cleared to zero.

=== MTIMECMP Registers (Offsets: 0x00000000 - 0x00007FF0)

The MTIMECMP registers are per-HART 64-bit read-write registers. It contains
the MTIME register value at which machine-level timer interrupt is to be
triggerred for the corresponding HART.

The matchine-level timer interrupt of a HART is pending whenever MTIME is
greater than or equal to the value in the corresponding MTIMECMP register.
The machine-level timer interrupt is reflected in the MTIP bit of the `mip`
CSR.

On reset, MTIMECMP registers are in unknown state.

=== Synchronizing Multiple MTIMER Devices

A RISC-V platform can have multiple HARTs grouped into hierarchical topology
groups (such as clusters, nodes, or sockets) where each topology group has
it's own MTIMER device. Further, such RISC-V platform can also allow
clock-gating or powering off for a topology group (including the MTIMER
device) at runtime.

On a RISC-V platform with multiple MTIMER devices, all must satisfy the
RISC-V architectural requirement that all the MTIME registers with respect
to each other, and all the per-HART `time` CSRs with respect to each other,
are synchronized within single MTIME tick (or MTIME update period).

The synchronization between MTIME registers should be done:

* By hardware after system reset in a platform specific way
* By software at runtime when any of the MTIMER device is out of sync
  due to power managment

When software updates one, multiple, or all MTIME registers, it must maintain
the preceding synchronization requirements (through measuring and then taking
into account the differing latencies of performing reads or writes to the
different MTIME registers).

As an example, the below RISC-V 64-bit assembly sequence can be used by
software to synchronize a MTIME register with reference to another MTIME
register.

        /* Return MTIME adjustment value */
        add       a0, t3, zero

        ret
----

*NOTE:* On some RISC-V platforms, the MTIME synchroinzation sequence (i.e.
the `aclint_mtime_sync()` function above) will need to be repeated few times
until delta between target MTIME register and reference MTIME register is
zero (or very close to zero).

== Machine-level Software Interrupt Device (MSWI)

The MSWI device provides machine-level IPI functionality for a set of
HARTs on a RISC-V platform. It has an IPI register (*MSIP*) for each
HART connected to the MSWI device.

The maximum number of HARTs supported by a single MSWI device is 4095
which is equivalent to the maximum number of MSIP registers.

=== MSIP Registers (Offsets: 0x00000000 - 0x00004FFC)

Each MSIP register is a 32-bit wide WARL register where the upper 31 bits
are tied to zero. The least significant bit is reflected in the MSIP bit
of the `mip` CSR. A machine-level software interrupt for a HART is pending
or cleared by writting '1' or '0' respectively to the corresponding MSIP
register.

On reset, each MSIP register is cleared to zero.

== Supervisor-level Software Interrupt Device (SSWI)

The SSWI device provides supervisor-level IPI functionality for a set of
HARTs on a RISC-V platform. It has an IPI register (*SSIP*) for each HART
connected to the SSWI device.

The maximum number of HARTs supported by a single SSWI device is 4095
which is equivalent to the maximum number of SSIP registers.

=== SSIP Registers (Offsets: 0x00000000 - 0x00004FFC)

Each SSIP register is a 32-bit wide WARL register where the upper 31 bits
are tied to zero. The least significant bit is reflected in the SSIP bit of
the `mip` CSR. A supervisor-level software interrupt for a HART is pending
or cleared by writting '1' or '0' respectively to the corresponding SSIP
register.

The RISC-V privilege specification defines SSIP bit of the `mip` CSR as
writeable. The supervisor-level software interrupt should be made pending
based on the logical-OR of software writable SSIP bit and the signal from
the external software interrupt device (such as SSWI device). When `mip`
CSR is read with a CSR instruction, the value of SSIP bit returned in the
`rd` destination register is the logical-OR of software writable SSIP bit
and the signal from the external software interrupt device (such as SSWI
device).

*NOTE:* Until the SSIP bit definition in the RISC-V privilege specification
is updated, the modified definition of SSIP bit described above should be
used to implement SSWI device on a RISC-V platform.

On reset, each SSIP register is cleared to zero.
